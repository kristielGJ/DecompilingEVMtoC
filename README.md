# DecompilingEVMtoC
This  project  is  an  academic  proposal  supervised  by  Martin  Nyx  Brain  and  Michał  Król.  The 
project  will  be  to  write  a  decompiler  so  that  it  can  convert  EVM  byte  code  into  C  that  can  be 
handled by the CPROVER tools

05/03: Majority of tests passed for the Dissasembly (Itteration 1), run this in the EvmDissasemble.java class, there is a main method that accepts EVM Byte code and dissasembles it to readable instructions
